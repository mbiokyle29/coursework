./partition.py --string ACTTTT
a: -2, b: 2, c: -1
The max partition had score 6:
A|C|TTTT

./partition.py --string ACTTTTC
a: -2, b: 2, c: -1
The max partition had score 6:
A|C|TTTT|C

./partition.py --string ACTTTTCT
a: -2, b: 2, c: -1
The max partition had score 7:
A|C|TTTTCT

The addition of another C causes a large change in the partition layout,
we drop the partition added with ACTTTTC

If we are thinking prefixes:
ACTTTTC  --> best is A|C|TTTT|C
ACTTTTCT --> best is A|C|TTTTCT

I dont know how we enumerate all the possible partitions within the matrix!

for A: 
    there are 4 labels so 4 possibilitites

for AA:
    there are two partitions:
    AA  --> 4 labels
    A|A --> 4*3 labels

for AAA:
    there are 
    AAA   --> 4
    A|A|A --> 4*3*3
    A|AA  --> 4*3
    AA|A  --> 4*3

for AAAA:
    
    A|A|A|A = 4*3*3*3
    
    A|AA|A
    A|A|AA  = 4*3*3
    AA|A|A  = 4*3*3

    A|AAA   = 
    AA|AA   =
    AAA|A   =

    AAAA
